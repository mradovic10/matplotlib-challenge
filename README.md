# matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Challenge

This challenge includes the main Jupyter Notebook file with the entire code and findings, a folder that contains the data that was used, and this README file.

The Jupyter Notebook file begins with an analysis of the findings, followed by a preparation of the data. After that, the statistics are summarized. Next, the data is visualized using bar and pie graphs, including box plots. Finally, the Notebook analyzes and graphs line and scatter plots, as well as correlation and regression.

Here are some resources that were used to help me figure out some specific coding:

Removing "g989" from DataFrame:

Aggregating DataFrame:

Changing color and style of outlier:

For pie charts and IQR analysis, I was helped by my brother who has data analysis knowledge.

Take care!
